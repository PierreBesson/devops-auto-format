# DevOps Code Auto Format

This project demonstrates the use of [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to auto format configuration files often used for DevOps tasks (YAML, JSON, Markdown).

Prettier is well known project in the JS community, but I believe that it is under appreciated for DevOps projects.

## Usage

Install dependencies and setup the pre-commit hook with:

    npm install

Run the formatter manually:

    npm run prettier:format
